Helmets designed for children are typically smaller in size, lightweight, and come with adjustable straps to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. Manufacturers are focused on creating helmets that not only protect but also offer a child-friendly design that appeals to both parents and young athletes. The demand for these helmets is increasing as more children participate in organized roller skating hockey events, often introduced at schools or youth leagues.
